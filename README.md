PhotoApp: PhotoClicker is an application that displays user interface of clicking pictures.
The reason, for this application is, I want to create a full-stack Mobile Application to demonstrate my art to the world.
Photo Click is part of its module.
PhotoApp is created using React Native framework for mobile application.


## Prerequisites

- Node js
- NPM installed
- This can be downloaded from Chocolatey.org (install the command): it will download the required packages (for windows) and homebrew.com (install the command) for Mac users

## Technology used

Technology used for this project is abstract:

- [Visual Studio Code] - A code editor
- [Node.js] - An opensource javascript runtime environment.
- [Expo-CLI] - Expo Command line
- [Javascript] - Programming language as React-Native is javascript framework
- [JDK] - A development kit

## Installation

After downloading the prerquisites go to command line and run as administrator or run the sudo command for mac users

Install the code.

It operates on any operating system on 64 bit system.
The packages installed are supposed to maintain the long term version as it will bring errors during code runtime

This PhotoClick application, will be integrated with the Music Store Application that demonstrates the form of art.
